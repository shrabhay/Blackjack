# Blackjack Game
## Description
The Blackjack Game is a Python implementation of the classic casino card game. This program allows users to play against a computer dealer in an interactive terminal-based environment. The game follows the standard rules of Blackjack, including calculating scores, handling Blackjack conditions, and determining winners based on the closest score to 21 without exceeding it.

## Features

* **Standard Blackjack Rules**:

  * Aces can count as 1 or 11, depending on the user's hand.

* **Dynamic Dealer AI**: The dealer will draw cards until their score is at least 17.
* **Replayable**: Users can play multiple rounds in one session.
